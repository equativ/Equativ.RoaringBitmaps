# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! To help maintain a healthy and productive environment, please follow these basic guidelines.

## Creating Issues

Here are the minimum requirements for creating a issue on this project.  
**Any issue with a too vague description or inappropriate language may be closed without notice**: it often takes orders of magnitude more time to answer theses than the time it took for the author to write them.

### 1. Clear and Descriptive Title
The title should give a quick understanding of what the issue is about.

Examples:
- ✅ "TypeError when processing empty strings"
- ✅ "Documentation unclear about parameter X usage"
- ❌ "It doesn't work"
- ❌ "Bad implementation"

### 2. Meaningful Description
Your description should help others understand your issue. While the format is flexible, please make sure to convey:
- What you're trying to do
- What's not working as expected
- Any relevant context that could help understand the situation

The key is being clear and providing enough information so others can understand and help you.

### 3. Respectful Communication
Remember that open source maintainers are volunteers working on this project in their free time. Please:
- Be respectful and constructive (there is no "it should be like this", or "this is bad"...)
- Understand that the project spirit may not align with your expectations
